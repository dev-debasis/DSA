// Package is basically a folder.
// Standard Industrial syntax for declaring Package is let's assume we are working on a project of pw and our project name is Calculator and the feature we are working on is Addition --> com.pw.calculator.addition   (Lower case preferred)


// ACCESS SPECIFIER
// There are 4 types of access specifier in Java
// 1. public --> Accessible from anywhere in the project 
// 2. protected --> Can access in same class, can access in different class of same package, can access outside of the package but the class should be subclass 
// 3. default (No access modifier) --> Can access in same class, can access in different class of same package
// 4. private --> Can access in same class only.


public class PackageAndAccessModifier {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}
